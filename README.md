🐾 Smart Pet Feeding System – IoT-Based Automatic Feeder
This project presents an IoT-enabled automatic pet feeding system designed to ensure timely and consistent feeding for pets, even in the owner's absence. Built around the ESP8266 microcontroller and integrated with the Arduino IoT Cloud, the system allows remote monitoring, real-time alerts, and scheduling via a smartphone app.

🔧 Key Features:
Automated food dispensing using a 360° servo motor
Ultrasonic sensor to detect pet presence and monitor food levels]
Real-time notifications via Arduino IoT Cloud app
Remote control and scheduling of feeding times
Wi-Fi connectivity for seamless cloud integration
User-friendly mobile dashboard

🛠 Technologies Used:
ESP8266 Microcontroller
HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
Arduino IoT Cloud
Servo Motor (360°)
Arduino IDE

🚀 Future Enhancements:
AI-based adaptive feeding schedules
Integration with smart home ecosystems
Health analytics and pet activity tracking
